# NeuralNetworkKerasAssigment3
This project builds and trains a Neural Network using TensorFlow Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories, such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and shoes. Each image is 28Ã—28 pixels and belongs to one of 10 predefined classes.
